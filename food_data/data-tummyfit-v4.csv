Stir often to break up the anchovies until a paste is formed, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the pasta and toss into the pan. Add the parsley, toss over high heat 1 minute and place on a plate. Serve immediately. To make the dough: Make a mound of the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and milk mixture. Using a fork, beat together the eggs and milk mixture and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated. Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up any leftover crusty bits. Discard these bits. Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. To shape the Bigoli: Knead dough until smooth and tight, and let rest 20 minutes. Note: Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of this recipe. They are essential for a light pasta. Cut the dough into 6 pieces, and run each piece through a meat grinder set to the smallest extrusion size. As the pasta exits, cut it into 12-inch pieces and immediately dust with flour. Lay out onto a cookie sheet dusted with cornmeal, being careful to keep the strands separate.

Put the cilantro, garlic, tamarind, 2 tablespoons plus one teaspoon of soy sauce, the onion, shallots, anchovies or anchovy paste, and the juice of half of one lime into your food processor. Pull the tamarind apart into small pieces before putting into the food processor, to make sure there are no hard seeds in it. If you want heat, add a fresh chili that has been coarsely chopped. Process for about ten seconds, scrape down, process again, scrape down and, if necessary, process a third time. You want the pieces to be small and the mixture well combined, but you do not want a liquidy puree. Heat the vegetable oil in a small, heavy saucepan with a lid.

While the fish is grilling, bring the sauce to a good simmer over medium heat. Add the rice wine and cook for a minute or two. Taste the sauce and add more lime juice or a pinch of sugar if it's too tart and salt, to taste. Flip the fish over and baste with the tamarind glaze.

Transfer to a bowl and add the mustard, shallots, fennel, thyme, fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, and lemon juice. Stir briefly. Mix in the olive oil with a fork. Season with salt and pepper. Taste the vinaigrette; it should be slightly acidic, so add more lemon juice if necessary. Let stand for at least 1 hour so the fennel softens and the flavors mingle. Make the brochettes: Heat a gas grill to medium high or prepare a medium hot charcoal fire. Cut the salmon crosswise into 1-inch-wide strips, 3to 4 oz. each. Thread the skewers through the salmon strips: starting at the tapered end, carefully pierce the flesh, pushing the skewer all the way through to the fat end until the point pokes through. When the grill is just on the hot side of medium (you should be able to hold your hand just above the grate for 2seconds), use tongs to clean the grate with a lightly oiled paper towel. Season the salmon lightly with salt and brush lightly with olive oil. Put the brochettes on the grill, skin side down, keeping the exposed skewer ends away from the fire if using bamboo. The salmon will cook quickly but not always at the same rate. Cook until the skin is crisp and it releases from the grill, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the brochettes with tongs or a spatula and cook another 1 minute. If necessary, turn again and cook another 1 minute. The salmon is done when the flesh feels firm and almost begins to flake apart. Put the brochettes on a platter and drizzle immediately with the vinaigrette.",45,https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/782-556x370.jpg,0,5.7692,1,1,0,0,0,0

Brown the chicken well on all sides, starting with the skin side facing the bottom of the pan to melt its fat. Sprinkle with a little salt and generous grindings of pepper. When you have browned the chicken well all over, turn down the heat to medium, remove the garlic, add the white wine and the vinegar, and cover the pan. When the liquid in the pan has evaporated by half, put in the chopped anchovies and the chopped half of the olives, turn the chicken pieces over, cover the pan, and continue cooking. Cook until the chicken is done through and through and feels very tender when pricked with a fork. Tilt the pan, pushing the chicken to one side to let the juices collect at the other end. Spoon off and discard most of the clear fat, but none of the brown cooking juices. Add the olive pieces, the parsley, and the basil and cook for 1 or 2 minutes longer, turning the chicken over once or twice. Add the lemon juice, turn the chicken pieces over, and transfer at once to a warm serving platter together with all the cooking juices in the pan.",60,https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/818-556x370.jpg,0,38.0,0,1,0,0,0,0

To serve, remove the top sheets of paper from the pounded meat. Invert the carpaccio portions onto four chilled 9-inch plates, and carefully peel back the remaining paper sheets.

Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the blender and puree it again for 10-20 seconds. Scrape the sides down again. Turn the blender on low and take the removable cap off the lid. Hold you hand over the hole, as it might spit a little. Pour the olive oil in slowly and put the cap back on. Turn the blender off and scrape the sides down one more time. Turn the blender back on low, then high for 60 seconds.Incidentally, this vinaigrette would be great with potatoes, chicken or turkey or just over a tossed salad. Rinse the fish under cold water. Now make sure its gills and scales are all removed; your fishmonger is not always so diligent about this task, and no one wants a scale on his plate. Gills can impart a bitter taste to the fish, so they need to go, too. Use a very sharp knife and make several slashes on the sides of the fish, maybe every inch or so. Make the cuts at an angle to the side of the fish, and slice down until you feel the spine. Do not sever the spine, however. These cuts will help the fish cook faster. Rub olive oil all over the fish and set it aside. Prepare your grill for high, direct heat. Scrape down the grates well and close the lid. Salt the fish well. Now grab a paper towel, a set of tongs, and some cheap vegetable oil. Bring all of this out to the grill. Fold the paper towel over several times, moisten it with the vegetable oil, and hold it with tongs to wipe down the grill grates. Lay the fish down on the grill and close the lid. Let this cook for 5 minutes without touching it. Open the lid and, using tongs, gently see if you can lift the fish off the grates cleanly. Dont actually do this, but check for sticky spots. If you have some, get a metal spatula. Use the spatula to dislodge the fish from the sticky spots.Using tongs in one hand, and the spatula in another, gently flip the fish over. If it sticks, no biggie. It happens sometimes. Once the fish has been flipped, let it cook another 3-5 minutes. Again, test for sticky spots with the tongs and spatula. Dislodge them gently and gently lift the fish onto a plate. If the fish is too long or seems like it might break in half, use two metal spatulas instead of the tongs-and-spatula set-up.Drizzle the vinaigrette over the fish and serve at once.

Prepare the sea bass: In a bowl, combine the lemongrass, red pepper flakes, garlic, turmeric, salt, sugar, and water. Add the sea bass, turning to cover it, and marinate for about 20 minutes. In a nonstick frying pan large enough to hold the fish, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the fillets and cook until just done, 5 to 6 minutes on each side. Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels. Serve the fish in a pool of green curry sauce.. Make Ahead Tips The green curry sauce will keep, covered and refrigerated, for about a week. Drink Suggestions For any dish with spicy heat, a sweeter wine gives you the best balance. Fruity-floral Rieslings and Gewrztraminers are ideal. Try Kabinett-level Rieslings from Gunderloch and Zilliken. Or try these varietals: from California, Edmeades Mendocino Gewrztraminer or Bonny Doons Pacific Rim Riesling; or from the Pacific Northwest, Amity Gewrztraminer of Oregon or Hogue Riesling from Washington. nutrition information (per serving): Size : with 1/4 cup sauce, Calories (kcal): 390, Fat (kcal): 21, Fat Calories (g): 190, Saturated Fat (g): 11, Protein (g): 35, Monounsaturated Fat (g): 5, Carbohydrates (mg): 16, Polyunsaturated Fat (mg): 3, Sodium (g): 1290, Cholesterol (g): 70, Fiber (g): 3, Photo: Alan Richardson Rate this Recipe and View Reviews",35,https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1026-556x370.jpeg,0,3.8363,1,0,1,0,0,0

Light charcoal in chimney starter and let burn 10 minutes. Carefully pour hot coals evenly over 2 opposite sides of bottom rack, leaving free of coals a trough down middle of bottom rack. Carefully pour remaining (unlit) charcoal over lit coals, banking them to the sides to maintain trough in middle. Let coals burn, uncovered, until smoldering (coals will turn from white to gray), about 1 hour. Stack opened paper bags on a work surface, then stack butcher-paper sheets on top.

Arrange fish flat lengthwise, side by side (head to tail) in middle of top sheet of stacked butcher paper. Squeeze lime juice over both sides of fish, then rub fish all over with cilantro mixture, being sure to rub mixture into slashes and all over inner cavities. Wrap fish in top sheet of butcher paper, overlapping long edges, then folding ends over fish. Turn package upside down to help keep closed, then wrap in second sheet of butcher paper in same manner. Turn package over again. Continue to wrap and turn fish in butcher paper and then brown bag sheets, 1 sheet at a time. Tuck short end of last few sheets inside ends of package to close. When coals are ready, fill a sink with water and immerse fish package for 1 minute to soak completely, then transfer to a shallow baking pan.

Rub the remaining teaspoon butter over the foil, leaving a 2-inch border all around. Turn up the edges of the papillote slightly to hold the liquid you will be adding. Spread half the leek and fennel slices on the foil to make a bed for the fish and dot with about half of the seasoned butter. Set the fish on top and scatter the remaining vegetables over it. Dot with the remaining seasoned butter, and drizzle with the wine. Seal the papillote by folding the foil in half over the fish. Starting at one folded corner, fold the edges of the foil over in neat pleats; be sure to fold each successive pleat so it slightly overlaps the previous one to make a tight seal. Continue until you have reached the other corner and the edges are tightly sealed. Slide the package onto a baking sheet. Bake the fish for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 3 minutes. With scissors, carefully cut the foil along the pleats, taking care to avoid the escaping steam. Fold back the flap to expose the fish. With two large spatulas, transfer the fish to a serving platter. Tilt the papillote so the juices run out of one corner and over the fish.

When the oil is warm, add the sliced onion and fennel to the pot, and season with salt and pepper. Allow the vegetables to sweat for 2 minutes, and then add in the sliced garlic. Cook the vegetables for another 3 minutes. Next, add in the can of drained petite diced tomatoes and the white wine. Raise the heat to high, and allow the wine to reduce slightly for about 2 minutes. Add the fish stock to the pot, and add in the saffron and the bay leaf. When the stock comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and allow the stock to simmer uncovered for 10 minutes. It is this part of the process from which ""bouillabaisse"" gets its name: the first part of the word means ""to boil, "" and the second, ""to lower."" The saffron will bloom in the simmering liquid, and will steep like tea in the stock, causing it to turn its trademark marigold color. Season again lightly with salt and pepper. After 10 minutes have passed, add in the rock shrimp and the mussels, and stir them around in the bouillabaisse broth. They should take no more than 3 minutes to cook; the shrimp will turn from grey to coral in color, and the mussels will open. While the stock is simmering, cook the sea bass. Begin by seasoning the sea bass well with salt and pepper on both sides. Then cover the bottom of a large nonstick sauté pan with olive oil—a typical pan will require about 2 tablespoons. Heat the oil on medium-high heat, and when the oil starts to shimmer, add the four filets of fish. Cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, until golden. Rouille with Baguette Toasts: To toast the baguette, arrange the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, and run into a 350-degree oven until dry and golden, about 10 minutes, but keep an eye on them.

Halve the fennel bulb and thinly slice one half. Cut the other half into 1/8-inch dice. Do the same with the onion. Take two pieces of aluminum foil and fold them together so that they form big piece (see photo below). Lay the foil shiny-side down on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Arrange half of the sliced red onion, sliced fennel and lime along the middle of the foil, over an area roughly the same size as the fish. Remove the fish from the marinade and slather the cavity with the mustard. Then scatter the butter chunks and the chopped onion and fennel inside the cavity, filling it just enough that it looks plump, without the vegetables spilling out all over the place. Lay the fish gently on top of the sliced vegetables, and then arrange the rest of them on top of the fish, finishing with a row of lime slices.

Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the eggs and oil. Using a fork, beat together the eggs and oil and begin to incorporate the flour, starting with the inner rim of the well. As you expand the well, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape. Do not worry that this initial phase looks messy. The dough will come together when half of the flour is incorporated. Start kneading the dough with both hands, using the palms of your hands. Once you have a cohesive mass, remove the dough from the board and scrape up and leftover crusty bits. Discard these bits. Lightly flour the board and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough should be elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead it for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust your board when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature. While the dough rests, in a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, heat 4 tablespoons oil until smoking. Add the garlic and cook until light golden brown, about 1 minute. Add the fish pieces and saute, stirring constantly, 8 to 9 minutes, until the fish is just cooked through. Remove fish to a mixing bowl and allow to cool. To the mixing bowl, add the 3 tablespoons chopped marjoram, mashed potato and 6 tablespoons oil and stir to mix well, being certain to break up all of the fish. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside. Roll out pasta to the thinnest setting on a pasta rolling machine and place on a lightly floured surface. If you have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, cover the layer of pasta with a 1/4-inch thick layer of the sea bass mixture. Place an equal sheet of pasta over and press down lightly with your hands. Carefully roll the 2 sheets together with the roller to form the ravioli. Using a pastry cutter, cut the ravioli apart by running down between the ravioli. If you do not have a ravioli-cutting rolling pin, then cut a single sheet of pasta at a time into rectangles 2 by 1-inch. Place 1 teaspoon of the fish mixture into the center of each rectangle and fold the pasta down like a piece of notebook paper and seal to form a 1-inch square. Repeat until all ingredients have been used. Bring 8 quarts of water to boil and add 3 tablespoons salt. Drop the ravioli in and cook 6 to 7 minutes, until tender and fully cooked. Meanwhile, in a 12 to 14-inch saute pan, combine tomato sauce, remaining oil and marjoram leaves and place over heat. Drain the ravioli, reserving cooking water, and add ravioli to the pan with tomato sauce. Toss the pasta to dress it with the sauce, adjust the moisture of the sauce with pasta water, if necessary, and serve immediately. In a 3-quart saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the thyme and carrot and cook 5 minutes more, until the carrot is quite soft. Add the tomatoes and juice and bring to a boil, stirring often. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes until as thick as hot cereal. Season with salt and serve.

Put the dried chiles, shallots, and garlic on separate sheets of foil, drizzle each with a little vegetable oil, and wrap each into a separate packet. Roast the three packets on a baking sheet until the contents of each is soft and golden: the chiles should take about 15 minutes, the garlic about 25 minutes, and the shallots about 35 minutes. When the chiles and shallots are cool enough to handle, chop each coarsely. Put them in a small food processor or mortar and pestle along with the roasted garlic, bonito flakes or smoked fish, palm or brown sugar, fish sauce, and tamarind juice or cherry juice concentrate. Blend or pound until smooth. Prepare the coconut: If youre using fresh coconut, bake the whole coconut at 375F for about 15 minutes. Set it aside to cool. Put the coconut on a hard surface; hit it hard with a hammer to split it in half, taking care to catch the juice, which you can save for drinking. With a sharp, thick knife, carefully dislodge the meat from the husk; wear a kitchen mitt to protect your hands. Peel the hard, dark, outer layer off the white meat. Cut the coconut flesh into small chunks; pulse in a food processor into small flakes. Toast the flakes in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until lightly golden, stirring frequently to prevent burning; let cool. Set aside 1/4 cup for the recipe and store the rest of the coconut flakes in a sealed jar; theyll keep for several weeks. Prepare the salad: In a small skillet over high heat, heat the vegetable oil and add the sliced shallots and salt, stirring constantly to prevent burning. Fry the shallots until crisped and golden, about 2 minutes; drain them on paper towels. Arrange the pomelo sections on a serving platter; top with the cooked shrimp. Toss gently with the dressing, taking care not to bruise the fruit. Garnish with 1/4 cup toasted coconut flakes, the roasted peanuts, fried shallots, fresh chiles, and lime leaves or zest.

Used my food processor because I wanted to put some extra flavor in the topping, so I addeda littleleft-over chorizo.Its the perfect way to putflavor and structure in your topping. You dont need a lot of chorizo, just a few tiny pieces. Pulsate until it ends up pretty fine. You can do this with any kind of hard sausage or even crumbled up bacon, or just stick to breadcrumbs and Parmesan if you like it plain.Peel a medium carrot. Finely mince the carrot and onion. You can alsoadd grated garlic if you like, I didnt add it this time.Chop as much (or as little) dill as you like or simply use dried dill. Im not too crazy about dill, but do like how it combines with fish, so used a moderate amount.Action shot! I love how this one came out. If the light outside gets so bad (during autumn) Im forced to use a tripod, I might as well use it to my advantage.Heat two tbsp butter and sautee the onion and carrot over medium heat. Keep stirring every now and then, nothing should end up browned.Thawed 4 pieces of whitefish fillet. Always have them in my freezer, you can do lots of things with them. They make great fish cookies with a little leftover mashed potatoes, some vegetables and fresh herbs.When the onions are translucent, add the fish. Just get it all in there, lower the heat and let it cook until it starts to fall apart. Flip it over every now and then.Pretty soon the fish is going to fall apart and flake. Break up the coarse pieces.Top the fish with 1 heaping tbsp flour, stir a bit and cook for one minute. Slowly pour in the milk while carefully stirring until you have a sauce consistency you like. It shouldnt be too thin, though.Add a good pinch of salt and pepper. I used my fingers and kept checking the seasoning, so cant give you exact quantities. It just varies every time I make this dish.Ive added 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard, its pretty heavy in flavor but goes really well with the fish. Use less if you like. Also threw in a heaping tbsp sour cream, and for lack of fresh lemon juice, I committed sacrilege and used one of those plastic jars and just squeezed a little in. Dont tell anyone!In goes the dill. Now simmer the sauce over low heat for another minute or two.Transfer it all to a baking dish. When you see this creamy fish concoction, you just know its gonna taste fantastic with french fries, right?Sprinkle the bread/Parmesan mix on top.Until everything is royally covered. Pop in a preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the top is golden brown and crispy.Serve with french fries and a nice mixed vegetable salad on the side. My boy doesnt even need utensils with this, he simply uses the fish as a dip for his French fries. No, I didnt raise him like that, but what can you do? :)PrintableRecipe kayotic.comClick hereto print recipes older than 2010e-mail this post to a friend",15,https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1598-556x370.jpg,0,6.1035,1,0,0,1,0,0

New Zealand makes many of the best unoaked chardonnays.

Add the beans to the boiling water and blanch for 2 to 3 minutes, then drain, transfer to the ice water to stop the cooking and set the color, drain again, and set aside. Heat a wide, deep, heavy-bottomed sauté pan over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the softened butter and, when it has melted but not browned, add the onion. Cook until soft and translucent but not browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the corn and blanched beans and stir to heat through. Pour in the stock and raise the heat to high. Continue to cook until the liquid has almost completely reduced but enough remains to lightly coat the vegetables, about 5 minutes total. Be careful not to overcook the sauce, as the vegetables may discolor. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside, covered, to keep warm.

In a hot cast-iron skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Sear the fish on both sides until the flesh is opaque about 3 minutes each side. Combine the Hollandaise Sauce with chili-garlic sauce, chipotle powder and crabmeat. Serve each fillet with 1/4 cup sauce. Combine all the ingredients and mix. Store in a sealed container. Melt the butter and margarine in a 1-quart saucepan over low heat. Raise the heat and bring to a rapid boil. Remove from the heat and cool, about 5 minutes. Skim the foam from the top and discard. Pour the butter into a large glass measuring cup and set aside. Meanwhile, in a medium stainless steel mixing bowl or in the top of a double boiler, combine all the remaining ingredients. Mix together with a metal whisk until blended. Place the bowl over a pan of slowly simmering, but not boiling, water. The bowl must never touch the water. Vigorously whisk the egg mixture, picking up the bowl frequently to let the steam escape. Whip until the egg mixture is very light and creamy and has a sheen, 6 to 8 minutes. This amount of beating is important so that the cooked eggs will better be able to hold the butter. Remove the bowl from the pan of hot water. Gradually ladle about 1/4 cup of the butter mixture (use the top butterfat, not the butter solids on the bottom) into the egg mixture while vigorously whipping the sauce. Make sure the butter you add is well mixed into the sauce before adding more. Continue gradually adding the surface butterfat until you've added about 1 cup. So that you can get to the butter solids, ladle out and reserve about 1/2 cup surface butterfat into the sauce, whisking well. Use any remaining bottom solids in another dish. Then, gradually whisk in enough of the reserved top butterfat to produce a fairly thick sauce. The butterfat thickens the sauce, so you may not need to use it all. Serve immediately (or as soon as possible, keeping the sauce in a warm place, such as on top of the stove, until ready to serve).",40,https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/1761-556x370.jpeg,0,11.023,0,0,0,1,0,0

Pour in enough water to just cover the salmon. Place the salmon over medium-high heat, and heat until the water is hot and steaming, but not simmering (165 degrees F (75 degrees C)); reduce heat if needed to keep the water at the proper temperature. Poach until the salmon turns opaque, and is firm to the touch; or to an internal temperature of 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Proceed making the Hollandaise sauce while the salmon is poaching.

Let soak for at least 5 minutes and up to 20 minutes. Set up your work area so that you can move quickly: position your serving plates or platter, the milk soaking pan, a pile of paper towels, and the seasoned flour on a plate. Have the melted butter in a small, heavy-based saucepan, and the lemon juice and parsley ready for action. In one or two large frying pans, heat the clarified butter over medium-high heat until very hot but not quite smoking. Lift a fillet from the milk, blot it on the paper towels, dip it into the flour, and shake off the excess. Carefully lay the fish in the hot fat. Repeat with the other fillets, but don't overcrowd the pan or you'll have trouble flipping. Adjust the temperature to keep the fat sizzling briskly but not burning. Cook the fish until golden on one side, about 2 minutes. With a slotted spatula, a large spoon, and great care, gently flip the fish. When the second side of the fish is golden brown and the flesh is tender when poked with a sharp knife in the thickest part, use the slotted spatula to remove the sole, set it on paper towels to drain briefly, and arrange on the warm platter or plates. When all the fillets are cooked, heat the melted whole butter carefully over medium-high heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until the butter is fragrant and the milk solids turn nutty brown; remove the pan from the heat so the butter doesn't keep cooking, but keep it hot. Working fast, pour 1 Tbs. of the lemon juice evenly over each fish and sprinkle on the parsley. Pour about 1-1/2 Tbs. of the hot browned butter on each fish -- if all has gone well, you'll see and hear a delicious sizzle. (If there's no sizzle, it will still taste great.)

To assess a chile's heat, slice off its top through the ribs and seeds, where the heat-producing compound capsaicin is concentrated. Touch the slice to your tongue. If you want your food to be milder, split the chile and scrape out all or some of the ribs and seeds. If your skin is sensitive, wear kitchen gloves or hold the chiles with a forkand don't touch your eyes.
